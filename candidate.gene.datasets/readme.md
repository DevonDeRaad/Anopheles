All 15 candidate gene datasets are present here. File structure is tidy format (1 observation per row): chromosome *space* position (i.e. base pair) *space* associated gene (within 1Kb)


e.g.

| chromosome 	| position  	| associated gene 	|
|------------	|-----------	|-----------------	|
| 2R         	|  19059512 	| AGAP002307      	|
