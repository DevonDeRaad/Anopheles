All 20 candidate gene datasets presented here.

File structure is tidy format: chromosome *space* position (i.e. base pair) *space* associated gene (within 1Kb)

Each row represents a single observation of a SNP associated with a gene (there can be more than one SNP associated with a gene and vice versa)
e.g.

| chromosome 	| position 	| associated gene 	|
|------------	|----------	|-----------------	|
| 2R         	| 19059512 	| AGAP002307      	|
| 2R         	| 19059512 	| AGAP002308      	|


Additionally, the entire set of identified outlier GEA SNPs is available at 'vetted.outliers.csv' with logical columns detailing whether each SNP passed our vetting procedure.
