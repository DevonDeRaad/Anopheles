#scripts and files to use naive bayes classifier in R to #1 classify outlier SNPs as 'locally adapted' (where a single pop is an outlier) or environmentally correlated (broad multi-pop relationship w/ env variable) #2&3 bring in phase2 data and classify each SNPs unique pattern as being 'matched' or 'rejected' by semi-independent phase2 data #4 identify the focal population for each 'locally adapted' SNP
